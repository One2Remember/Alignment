On Tenglings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mating:

All tengs have two primary sexual organs:
	The 'koola' is akin to a cloaca in reptiles.
	The 'tint' is akin to both a tongue and a penis.

Two tengs mate and one or both becomes pregnant. 

The pregnant party, or bearer, internally incubates the egg for three months before zey lay the clutch, which zey incubate by burying near the surface under warm sand for three more months. 

The other mate, the watcher, will then take over responsibility of the eggs and ensure they are properly protected from predators, and will roost above the eggs at night to keep them warm.

In the case that both become pregnant, which is extremely rare, it is seen as a good omen for the offspring, which will be born in matching pairs, one to each parent, and each parent acts as both bearer and watcher for their own clutch.
