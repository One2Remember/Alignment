Zo Part 1 Outline:

Zo begins to brainstorm ideas of how to make it to the testing center. After research and deliberation, ze asks how all the different species can study at the same planet. Were they all constantly holding onto the laws from their home planets? That’d be extremely difficult. Zo learns that the university provides them with devices that pull laws through from other Core Worlds with similar conditions. The extremely complex signals generated by the different world were a subject of constant study in the University, as a major subject. The signals for many of the core worlds had been cracked, which allows the University to create technology based on the laws of physics from that world, another major field of study.
In order to journey to Pharphesis, one has to pass the test at the testing center which permits them to take the teleplatform over. But world-hoppers can teleport themselves if they can ‘hear’ the signal of the destination world. That data is available on the internet, but in order to display the signal, Zo needs a device capable of generating it, which is advanced tech. Zo needs to figure out how to build a device which can generate the electric signal which Pharphesis. Ze is at the bazaar looking for the parts ze needs when Adyn appears.
