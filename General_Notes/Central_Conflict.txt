Central Conflict: 

1. Most worlds in the alignment are kept economically destitute, essentially vassal universes for the Core Worlds.
 
	- Because of this, Zo's planet is plagued by drug use and violence, gangs who fight to control over the meager scraps they have. When Zo travels across the ocean ze comes to find that life isn't as great across the ocean as ze thought. The whole planet is being subjugated. The only reason they have any relevance in the alignment is there meager contribution of metal deposits. Many work at the mines and refineries, which is extremely dangerous work.
		- Zo loses Iko to the mines. Damn. Yeah.
	
	- Because of this, Adyn's planet is kept under severe scrutiny. Something about human nature makes them very susceptible to demonic influence as well as channeling ability. 
		- The planet is almost destroyed, as the demons threated the entire Alignment, but they enter into an agreement with the Alignment worlds. Omnara actually possesses some vast quantities of a useful resource - channelers. The Holy King of Ixpanta was given technology to dominate his lands, as long as he funneled the resource of channelers to the Alignment. 
		- He does this by enforcing a religion in which all magic is illegal, and all channelers are captured and sent to work.
		
2. There is a God that wants to bring all realities together and recreate the singularity. To do so, it must bring together enough worlds into one place in higher dimensional space to form super black holes. It has done this before, many times. Our story is the result of its most recent attempt.

3. The historical records claim that the Odeamani were the ones to bring together the first alignment worlds, to study them. (This is wrong, it was Satan). The Odeamani, prior to meeting other races, had no notion of death, pain, sadness, etc. There was a schism over how to deal with these new worlds. Some wanted to leave them be, some wanted to help them. This schism escalated until one Odeamani entered one of the worlds and began annihilating the sentient life, so that the rest of the life could grow unhindered (think humans on Earth). He was hastily executed, sparking an all out war between the demons. (At this point, Narzha fled and isolated herself on Vatrik). This war lasted a thousand years, spanning many worlds. During this time, a rudimentary government was formed among the fledgling worlds. Technology fluorished. Eventually the Odeamani who wanted to intercede almost won, but found themselves outmatched by the great coalition of worlds who joined the side that wanted to let them live in peace. The Odeamani who had fought to intercede were locked away on their worlds. Those who had fought to let the other species live in peace became exalted and fled back to their own world, which they intentionally locked away from outsiders.
 
	a. The coalition of worlds that fought the demons went on to become the Alignment. Strict rules were put in place to limit all contact with the demons. 
	
	b. However, due to Satan's influence,
